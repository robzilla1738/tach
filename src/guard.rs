//! The coding-agent guard session — Tach's runtime for an externally-edited repo.
//!
//! Unlike the repair loop (which fixes toy source in memory) or the action layer
//! (which calls fake tools), a *guard* session governs a real repo that an
//! external agent (Claude Code, Codex, …) edits with its own tools. Tach does not
//! make the edits; it is the guardrail and the ledger:
//!
//!   begin   snapshot the working tree as a baseline; open the session
//!   diff    classify what changed against the goal's `fs.write` scope (read-only)
//!   verify  reject out-of-scope edits; run the required commands for real, each
//!           captured as a receipt; set the `verified` bit
//!   commit  if verified and unchanged-since-verify, finalize into Tach's ledger
//!   abort   cancel the session
//!
//! Honesty: with no sandbox, Tach cannot *prevent* an out-of-scope write — the
//! agent has already touched the tree by the time `verify` runs. It is a
//! detect-and-reject gate: the violation is recorded and the commit is blocked.
//!
//! The verify step reuses the action layer's correctness spine — a receipt is the
//! commit point and is keyed by an idempotency key, so a crashed-then-re-run
//! `verify` over an unchanged tree reuses the receipt instead of re-running the
//! command. The key folds in a digest of the working tree, so an *edited* tree
//! correctly yields a fresh run rather than a stale reuse.
