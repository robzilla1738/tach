//! Append-only event history for goal runs.
//!
//! A long-horizon agent run is not a single saved blob; it is a *log*. Every
//! meaningful thing that happens — a diagnostic emitted, a patch proposed,
//! verified, applied or rejected, a checkpoint written, the run completing —
//! becomes one immutable line of JSON appended to `events.jsonl`. That log is
//! the source of truth: `tach goal inspect` reads it, `tach goal resume` extends
//! it, and nothing rewrites history. Because events carry a logical sequence
//! number rather than a wall-clock time (`timestamp_mode: "deterministic"`), two
//! runs of the same deterministic goal produce byte-identical logs.
