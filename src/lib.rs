//! Tach — the fast language for coding agents.
//!
//! Tach is a small compiled language whose toolchain is built to cooperate with the
//! agentic coding loop: prompt -> patch -> compile -> test -> repair -> merge.
//!
//! The headline idea: the compiler is also an agent harness. Every diagnostic carries
//! a machine-applicable repair (`preferred_patch`), so an agent — even a deterministic
//! one — can drive a failing project to green without guessing.
