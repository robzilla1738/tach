# Tach

**A typed goal runtime for long-horizon agents.**

*The fastest path from a failing goal to a verified result.*

</div>

---

Tach gives an agent's goals a **typed, deterministic, auditable control plane**. A goal
runs with a budget it can't exceed, an authority it can't escape, checkpoints it can
resume from, an event history that records everything it did, and a verification pipeline
that refuses any change that breaks the build, regresses a test, or reaches outside the
scope it was granted. Use Tach when you want an agent to pursue a goal **without losing
state, exceeding authority, repeating side effects, or making untraceable changes.**

The foundation is a language whose **compiler is also an agent harness**. Most languages
were designed for humans to write and a machine to run; Tach is designed for the loop
agents live inside:

```
goal → budget → authority → diagnostic → typed patch → verify → checkpoint → resume → trace
```

The bet that makes it work: if the compiler emits *repairs* instead of just complaints,
the agent driving it can be *trivial*. Every Tach diagnostic carries a machine-applicable
`preferred_patch` — a byte-span replacement that fixes the problem — and `tach fix` can
drive a broken project from red to green **with no model in the loop**. The goal runtime
wraps that loop in durability: budgets, checkpoints, resume, replay, and a per-step event
log.

This repo is a **working compiler, toolchain, and goal runtime**: a real lexer, a Pratt
parser, a type + effect checker that emits patch-carrying diagnostics, user-defined sum
types with `match`, a deterministic interpreter, a hermetic test runner, the typed-patch
verification pipeline, the agent repair loop (with a pluggable coder seam), the `goal`
language construct, a durable goal store with append-only event history and
crash/resume/replay, a canonical formatter, versioned JSON schemas, and a suite-level
benchmark — all in Rust, in a single static binary with **zero language-model dependency**
for everything that matters.

## The 60-second demo

```console
$ tach new demo && cd demo

$ tach check
error[E0421]: function `load_session` performs undeclared effects `db.read`, `log.write`, `time.read`
  --> src/auth.tach:15:4

```

**Tach fixed the bug in three laps** — with no model in the loop. The intelligence is in
the compiler's output, not the agent.

## The goal runtime

`tach fix` is the loop. A **goal** is that loop made durable: budgeted, authority-scoped,
checkpointed after every step, and resumable. A fresh project ships with one:

```tach
goal FixFailingTests -> Success {
  budget {
    steps: 30
    retries: 3
  }
  allow {
    effect db.read
    effect db.write
    effect time.read
    effect log.write
    fs.write ["src/**", "tests/**"]
  }
  require {
    tests.pass
    no_new_effects
  }
}
```

The killer demo: **run it, crash it mid-flight, and resume to green without repeating a
single patch.**

```console
$ tach goal run FixFailingTests --crash-after step:2
● FixFailingTests  run_69c04fc4d55f672e
  status               running
  steps                2
  patches-applied      2
  ✗ crashed after step 2 (simulated). State is durable.
  resume with  tach goal resume run_69c04fc4d55f672e

$ tach check        # the working tree is untouched — a crash never half-edits your code
  ● 1 error(s) ...

$ tach goal resume run_69c04fc4d55f672e
● FixFailingTests  run_69c04fc4d55f672e
  status               completed
  steps                3
  patches-applied      3       ← the third patch only; the first two were not repeated
  ✓ updated src/auth.tach

$ tach goal replay run_69c04fc4d55f672e
  ● replay reproduced the run exactly — 3 step(s), completed
```

Everything the run did is an immutable line in an append-only log
(`.tach/goals/<id>/events.jsonl`, schema `tach.event.v1`):

```console
$ tach goal inspect run_69c04fc4d55f672e
event history
   3  diagnostic.emitted     E0421 effect_undeclared
   4  patch.proposed         fix:effect_undeclared
   6  patch.applied          fix:effect_undeclared
   8  checkpoint.written     step 1
  ...
  15  run.resumed            from step 2
  21  checkpoint.written     step 3
  22  run.completed
```

The goal's `allow` block is **authority, not documentation**: a patch that would write
outside `src/**`/`tests/**`, or perform an effect the goal was never granted, is rejected
by the same verification pipeline that runs the tests — *before* it touches disk. The
runtime is deterministic and offline: the run id is derived from the goal and its source,
so `resume`, `replay`, and `inspect` are addressable with no clock and no randomness.

## Why this is different

Rust made memory safety central. Bun made JS tooling feel instant. Tach makes the
**agentic coding loop** feel instant, and measures itself on a new axis:

| Old benchmark        | Tach benchmark         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `12 ns` per call     | **time-to-green**      |
| binary size          | **patches-to-green**   |
| compile time         | **tests-run-per-fix**  |
| —                    | **regressions-per-run**|

```console
$ tach bench
Tach bench · agent loop
  status               green
  time-to-green        481µs
  laps-to-green        3
  patches-applied      3
  tests-run            9
  regressions          0
  diff-size            54 chars
```

## Three ideas that make it work

### 1. Diagnostics are repairs

Every error is *agent-shaped*. The same diagnostic renders as a friendly caret block
for humans and as stable JSON for machines:

```console
$ tach check --json
```
```json
{
  "code": "E0421",
  "kind": "effect_undeclared",
  "span": { "start": 240, "end": 252 },
  "repair_strategies": ["add_effect"],
  "preferred_patch": {
    "file": "src/auth.tach",
    "span": { "start": 300, "end": 300 },
    "replacement": "effects [db.read, log.write, time.read] ",
    "rationale": "declare the effects this function performs"
  }
}
```

Nine diagnostics ship today, and every one that admits a mechanical fix carries a
`preferred_patch`:

| Code | Kind | The fix it carries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `E0322` | `unknown_module` | insert the missing `import` |
| `E0421` | `effect_undeclared` | add / extend the `effects [...]` clause |
| `E0450` | `effect_unused` *(warning)* | trim effects the function doesn't perform |
| `E0309` | `type_mismatch` | fix the annotation, or convert the value |
| `E0330` | `unknown_field` | rename to the nearest field (did-you-mean) |
| `E0340` | `non_exhaustive_match` | insert an arm for each missing variant |
| `E0341` | `unknown_variant` | rename to the nearest variant (did-you-mean) |
| `E0460` | `unused_import` *(warning)* | remove the unused `import` line |
| `E0461` | `unused_variable` *(warning)* | prefix the binding with `_` |

The did-you-mean repairs only fire when a real name is a small edit away — they never guess
wildly, because an agent would dutifully apply a bad rename.

### 2. Agents submit typed patches, not raw diffs

The repair loop never edits files directly. It submits a **scoped, typed patch** that the
pipeline verifies *before* anything is written. A patch is rejected if it:

- **reaches outside its declared scope** — `touched file outside allowed scope: src/billing.tach`
- **introduces a new effect** — `introduced new effect: net.write`
- **breaks compilation** — `patch introduced 1 syntax error`
- **regresses a test** — `regressed test: auth.refresh.expired_token`

Only the **impacted** tests (found by call-graph analysis) are run, so verification is
proportional to the change, not the repo.

### 3. Effects are first-class

A function declares what it can do. The checker infers what it *actually* does and
reconciles the two. That makes a function's blast radius obvious to a reviewer — or an
agent deciding whether it's safe to run in a test:

```console
$ tach audit
  load_session (String) -> Result<Session, AuthError> effects [db.read, log.write, time.read]
      ⚠ db.read   reads from the database
      log.write   writes to the log
      time.read   reads the wall clock
  session_summary (Session) -> Int
      pure — no declared effects
```

## Racing repair strategies

Agentic coding is parallel. `tach race` runs several repair strategies speculatively,
each in an **isolated copy** of the workspace, then merges the first verified winner —
green, with the smallest diff:

```console
$ tach race
Tach race · 3 branches, isolated
  ● minimal   green · 3 laps · diff  54 · 795µs   ← winner
  ● convert   green · 3 laps · diff  71 · 880µs
  ● strict    green · 3 laps · diff  54 · 755µs
  ● winner: minimal — green with the smallest verified diff
```

Because every run is deterministic, `tach trace` and `tach replay` re-open and reproduce
any loop exactly.

## Install / build

Requires a Rust toolchain (1.75+).

```console
$ git clone <this-repo> tach && cd tach
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/tach --help
```

The result is a single static binary. Put `target/release/tach` on your `PATH`.

## A taste of the language

Tach is deliberately boring for humans and easy for models: one formatter's worth of
style, explicit effects, explicit `?`, no macro magic.

```tach
import db
import time

type Session = {
  token: String
  user_id: Int
  expires_at: Int
}

fn load_session(token: String) -> Result<Session, AuthError>
  effects [db.read, time.read]
{
  let row = db.query("select * from sessions where token = ?", token)?
  ensure row.expires_at > time.now()
  return Ok(Session { token: row.token, user_id: row.user_id, expires_at: row.expires_at })
}

test "expired session is rejected" {
  db.seed("old", { token: "old", user_id: 7, expires_at: 1 })
  ensure load_session("old").is_err()
}
```

It also has user-defined **sum types** and `match` — and a `match` on an enum must cover
every variant, or the compiler hands you a patch that inserts the missing arm:

```tach
type Parity = Even | Odd

fn describe(p: Parity) -> String {
  return match p {
    Even => "even"
    Odd => "odd"
  }
}
```

There's **one formatter**: `tach fmt` renders any file to a single canonical, idempotent
style, and `tach fmt --check` gates it in CI.

See [`docs/LANGUAGE.md`](docs/LANGUAGE.md) for the full tour.

## How it's built

Single Rust crate, cleanly separated modules:

```
src/
  lexer · parser · ast       front-end (spans double as edit coordinates)
  check · types · builtins   type + effect analysis → structured diagnostics
  interp · runner            deterministic tree-walking runtime + test runner
  patch                      Workspace, typed patches, the verify pipeline, impact analysis
  agent                      the fix loop, the coder seam, race, suite bench, metrics
  goal · event · store       the goal contract, append-only event history, durable store
  runtime                    the durable executor: budgets, checkpoint, resume, replay
  fmt · schema               the one canonical formatter, versioned JSON schemas
  trace · render · cli       persistence, pretty output, the `tach` binary
```

The design notes are in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## What's real, and what's next

**Real today:** the language runs — records, `Result`, effects, and user-defined sum
types with `match`; the checker finds effect, type, import, field, and exhaustiveness
bugs and emits machine-applicable patches (including did-you-mean renames and an
insert-the-missing-arm fix for non-exhaustive matches); the typed-patch pipeline enforces
scope, effects, and regressions; the deterministic loop drives the demo to green;
`tach bench --suite corpus` benchmarks the loop over a suite of broken projects, one per
diagnostic family. **The goal runtime is real:** `goal` is a first-class language
construct with `budget`/`allow`/`require` blocks; `tach goal run` drives the loop under
those constraints, checkpointing after every step into a durable store with an append-only
`tach.event.v1` event history; `tach goal resume` recovers a crashed run from its last
checkpoint **without repeating work**; `tach goal replay` proves a run reproduces; and the
`allow` block is enforced as real authority by the verification pipeline. There's a
pluggable coder seam (`tach fix --coder fixture`) whose proposals still go through the
exact same pipeline; `tach fmt` gives one canonical, idempotent style; `tach schema`
publishes versioned JSON schemas for every machine output; and `tach doctor` /
`tach explain` round out the toolchain. **41 passing tests** plus two end-to-end checks
(red→green, and crash→resume→replay) and a schema-validation step in CI.

**Near-term follow-ups (the roadmap the runtime is built for):** receipts + idempotency
for side-effecting tools, human-approval interrupts (`Proposed`/`Approved`/`Receipt`),
typed memory lanes with a context-drift detector, an existing-repo `Tachfile` mode that
wraps Bun/Cargo/Go test commands, MCP client/server, and a portable goal ABI. The event
log, durable store, and authority model added here are exactly the substrate those phases
hang off. Also: multi-file user imports and comment-preserving formatting.

**Deliberately scoped out:** native/LLVM codegen (today it interprets), a borrow checker,
a package manager, an LSP server, and a *model-backed* coder. The loop already has the
seam — a `Coder` trait, exercised offline by a deterministic fixture coder — so a real
model slots in behind a flag later, with every model output flowing through the same
patch/effect/test/authority pipeline. The core demo and the whole test suite stay
model-free, so everything is fully reproducible offline.

## Testing

```console
$ cargo test               # unit + integration tests (41)
$ bash scripts/e2e.sh      # new → check → fix → test demo, asserts green
$ bash scripts/goal_e2e.sh # goal run → crash → resume → replay, asserts no repeated work
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs all three on every push, plus `tach fmt --check` and
JSON-schema validation. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for notes aimed at
automated/cloud agents.
