//! Tach — a typed goal runtime for long-horizon agents.
//!
//! Tach gives an agent's goals a typed, deterministic, auditable control plane:
//! goal -> budget -> authority -> diagnostic -> typed patch -> verify -> checkpoint
//! -> resume -> trace.
//!
//! The foundation is a small compiled language whose compiler is also an agent
//! harness: every diagnostic carries a machine-applicable repair (`preferred_patch`),
//! so an agent — even a deterministic one — can drive a failing project to green
//! without guessing. The goal runtime wraps that loop in durability: budgets,
//! authority scopes, append-only event history, checkpoints, resume, and replay.
