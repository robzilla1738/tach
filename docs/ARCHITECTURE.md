# Architecture

Tach's toolchain is one Rust crate (lib + `tach` binary) with sharply separated modules.
The throughline of the design: **a span is both "where the error is" and "where to edit."**
Keeping a single byte-offset coordinate space across diagnostics and patches is what makes
machine repair clean.

## The pipeline

```
source ──▶ lexer ──▶ parser ──▶ AST ──┬──▶ checker ──▶ Diagnostics (+ preferred_patch)
                                       └──▶ interpreter ──▶ values / test results
                                                  ▲
                          Workspace ──▶ Patch ──▶ verify ──▶ commit
                                                  │
                                            agent loop (fix / race)
                                                  │
              goal (budget · authority · require) ──▶ runtime ──▶ events + checkpoints
                                                  │                       │
                                            durable store  ◀── resume / replay
```

The bottom two rows are the **goal runtime**: the same repair loop, made durable. A `goal`
declares a budget it can't exceed and an authority it can't escape; the runtime drives the
loop under those constraints, emitting an append-only event per step and a checkpoint after
each one, so a crashed run resumes from exactly where it stopped and a finished run replays
byte-for-byte.

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `span` | byte-range spans; insertion points are zero-width spans |
| `source` | offset → line/column, source slicing |
| `lexer` | tokens with spans; newlines significant except inside `()` / `[]` |
| `ast` | the tree, with **patch-precise** span fields (`brace_offset`, effects-clause spans, return-type span, field/variant name spans); records, `Result`, sum types, `match`, and the goal `plan` block (`PlanStmt`: `let`/`call`/`approve`/`if`/`for`/`while`) |
| `parser` | recursive descent + Pratt expressions; a `no_record_lit` flag disambiguates `if cond {` / `match x {` / `for x in expr {` from `Name {`; the plan block reuses the expression grammar with `call`/`approve`/`for`/`while`/`in` as contextual keywords |
| `diagnostics` | the `Diagnostic` type: human message **and** machine fields (`kind`, `repair_strategies`, `preferred_patch`) |
| `types` | the type lattice, lenient structural compatibility (`Unknown` ~ anything), and the registry of record fields + enum variants |
| `builtins` | builtin module members, their effects, and effect metadata |
| `check` | effect inference vs. declared effects, type checking, import checking, field-access and `match` exhaustiveness checks, and the unused-import / unused-variable lints — every mechanical one emits a `preferred_patch` |
| `value` / `interp` | deterministic tree-walking interpreter; `?` / `ensure` / `return` modeled as non-local control flow; sum-type variants and `match` |
| `runner` | the test runner + impact-scoped runs |
| `patch` | `Workspace`, `Edit`, `Patch`, the verify pipeline, call-graph impact analysis, glob scoping |
| `agent` | the `fix` loop, the optional `Coder` seam (default off), speculative `race`, the suite benchmark, the agent-era `Metrics`, and the shared repair leaves (`collect_problems`, `pick_candidate`, `build_patch`) the goal runtime reuses |
| `goal` | the resolved `GoalSpec` (budget, authority, success conditions), decoupled from spans so it serializes into the store |
| `event` | the `tach.event.v1` envelope and the append-only JSONL `EventLog` |
| `store` | the durable goal store: `goal.json`, `state.json`, `events.jsonl`, `checkpoints/`, `approvals/`, `receipts/` (each receipt self-describing — run/step/effect/input-hash/approval/recording-event), the deterministic source `fingerprint`, canonical idempotency/approval ids, **atomic writes** (temp-file + rename), and unique run-id allocation |
| `runtime` | the durable executor — `step_once`/`drive` (the repair loop), the action layer's `drive_actions` (a fixed plan with approval gates and receipts), and the plan language's `drive_plan` (durable re-execution of a `plan` block); `resolve_plan` re-parses a user goal's frozen source snapshot on resume (catalog for built-ins); `resume_run`/`replay_run` dispatch on `GoalRecord.kind` |
| `action` | the linear action layer: the `ActionPlan` model, the offline deterministic **fake tools** (`invoke_fake_tool`), and the built-in goal catalog (`ResolveDuplicateCharge`, `ShipHotfixPR`) |
| `plan` | the **plan language**: the pure expression evaluator (AST `Expr` → JSON value) and the built-in plan-goal catalog (`ReconcileChargebacks`, `RetryFlakyDeploy`); user-authored plan goals run the same interpreter from a workspace `plan` block. The durable interpreter and `check::check_plan_goal` (the `tach goal check` linter) live in `runtime`/`check` |
| `fmt` | the one canonical formatter — a precedence-aware, idempotent AST pretty-printer (goals included) |
| `schema` | versioned JSON Schemas for every machine output, embedded and served by `tach schema` |
| `trace` | persist/load `fix`/`race` runs to `.tach/trace.json` (the per-goal history lives in the store) |
| `render` / `term` | pretty, colored human output (JSON is the machine path) |
| `project` / `cli` | file discovery, scaffolding, suite loading, the command dispatcher |

## The verify pipeline (`patch::verify_patch`)

A patch is checked against a base `Workspace` without mutating it:

1. **Scope** — every edit's file must match the patch's `touches` globs.
2. **Apply** to a clone (edits per file applied in descending offset order so they don't
   invalidate each other).
3. **Compile** — the patched workspace must still parse and check.
4. **Effect delta** — the set of effects the program *performs* (inferred from bodies) must
   not gain a new member, unless explicitly allowed. Declaring an effect doesn't count as
   introducing one; adding a `net.post(...)` call does.
5. **API changes** — changed public signatures are reported (blocking only if requested).
6. **Impacted tests** — the call graph determines which tests can be affected; only those
   run, and a test that passed before but fails after is a rejection.

The verdict carries the post-patch workspace, so an accepted patch is committed by simply
swapping it in.

## The agent loop (`agent::fix`)

```
loop:
  diagnostics = parse_errors ++ check(workspace)
  if no errors and tests green: status = green; stop
  pick the earliest diagnostic that carries a preferred_patch
  if none:
    if a Coder is wired in: patch = coder.propose(...)   # the seam, default off
    else: status = stuck; stop
  patch = build a typed patch from it (scoped to its file)
  verdict = verify_patch(workspace, patch)
  if accepted: workspace = verdict.workspace   # advance one lap
  else: status = stuck; stop
```

Re-checking every lap means spans are always fresh, so applying one patch at a time never
trips over offsets shifted by an earlier edit. The loop is deterministic, so `race` can run
strategies on threads and `replay` can reproduce a run from its recorded base files.

### The coder seam

When structured repair is exhausted — a syntax error, or a logic bug with no
patch-carrying diagnostic — an optional `Coder` may propose a typed `Patch`. It gets **no**
special privileges: its proposal flows through the exact same `verify_patch` pipeline and is
committed only if it passes scope, effect, API, and regression checks. The default loop
uses no coder at all, so it stays model-free and fully reproducible; `FixtureCoder` is a
deterministic implementation that replays canned patches for offline tests, and a
model-backed coder is a future implementation of the same trait behind a flag.

### Benchmarking over a corpus

`agent::run_suite` runs the loop over every project in a suite (e.g. `corpus/`, one broken
project per diagnostic family) and aggregates the metrics — time-to-green, patches-to-green,
tests-run, regressions — so the thesis is measured over more than the single demo.

## The goal runtime (`runtime`)

A `goal` is the repair loop made durable. The same leaves run — `collect_problems`,
`pick_candidate`, `build_patch`, `verify_patch` — but each step is wrapped in a policy gate,
an event, and a checkpoint.

```
drive(goal, workspace):
  loop:
    if step >= budget.steps: status = budget_exhausted; stop
    outcome = step_once(workspace, goal)          # pure decision, shared with replay
    match outcome:
      Done:      status = completed; emit run.completed; stop
      NoAction:  status = failed;    emit run.failed;    stop
      Patch:
        emit diagnostic.emitted, patch.proposed
        verify under VerifyOpts { allowed_effects, allowed_writes }   # the goal's authority
        if accepted: workspace = new; emit patch.applied
        else:        emit patch.rejected; if consecutive > budget.retries: fail
        step += 1
        write checkpoint(step); emit checkpoint.written; save state
        if crash_after == step: return (durable, not finalized)
```

Three properties carry the design:

- **Authority is enforced, not advertised.** The `allow` block becomes `VerifyOpts`:
  `allowed_effects` rejects a patch that would perform an ungranted effect; `allowed_writes`
  rejects an edit outside the granted `fs.write` globs. Both are caught by the *same*
  pipeline that runs the tests, before anything touches disk.
- **Resume never duplicates work.** A checkpoint stores the post-step workspace. Resuming
  loads the latest checkpoint and continues, so the patches already applied are simply
  *not* re-derived — `step_once` sees a workspace where those diagnostics are gone. The
  event log is appended (a `run.resumed` boundary), never rewritten.
- **Determinism makes it addressable; allocation keeps it safe.** `store::fingerprint` is
  an FNV-1a hash of the goal name and its base source — no clock, no randomness — so the
  first run of a goal is addressable as a clean `run_<hash>`. But a fingerprint is *not* an
  identity: `store::allocate_run` turns it into a unique run id by atomically claiming a
  fresh directory (`fs::create_dir`, which fails if it already exists), handing later runs
  `run_<hash>-2`, `-3`, …. A fresh run therefore can never collide with — or overwrite — an
  existing run, and `EventLog::create` uses `create_new` as a last line of defense, refusing
  to clobber any existing history. `replay_run` re-derives a run with the pure `simulate`
  (the same `step_once`, no I/O) and proves it reproduces the recorded final state.

The working tree is never half-edited: the runtime operates on an in-memory `Workspace` and
only writes verified files back when a run reaches `completed`. A crash leaves the source
exactly as it was; the durable state lives entirely under `.tach/goals/<run_id>/`.

### The store layout

```
.tach/goals/<run_id>/
  goal.json               the resolved GoalSpec + the base source snapshot
  state.json              the mutable RunState head (status, step, metrics)
  events.jsonl            append-only history (one tach.event.v1 per line)
  checkpoints/<step>.json a workspace snapshot taken after each step (repair runs)
  approvals/<id>.json     a human approval gate on an effect (action + plan runs)
  receipts/<id>.json      durable proof an effect ran exactly once (action + plan runs)
```

For action and plan runs the durable truth is the `approvals/` and `receipts/` dirs (plus the
event log); `state.json` is a cosmetic head. All durable writes are **atomic** — staged to a
sibling `.tmp` file and `rename`d into place — so a crash mid-write can never leave a half-written
receipt that `list_receipts` would silently skip and a resume would mistake for "not yet done"
(which would re-run the effect). The rename is the commit; a leftover `.tmp` is harmless.

## The action layer (`action` + `runtime::drive_actions`)

A *business* goal is the same durable spine — run ids, the append-only log, `state.json` —
but its unit of work is not "verify a typed patch", it is "invoke a tool and write a receipt".
It runs a fixed `ActionPlan` (Rust data, from a built-in catalog; the goal's authority/budget
live in a real `goal` declaration), where steps may pause for human approval and effectful
steps must produce a receipt. `tach goal run ResolveDuplicateCharge` is the killer demo: look
up a duplicate charge, refund it **behind an approval gate**, notify the customer, close the
ticket — with *exactly one* refund, even across a crash.

```
drive_actions(goal, plan):
  loop:
    if cursor >= budget.steps: budget_exhausted; stop      # budget bills the cursor
    if cursor >= plan.len:     completed; stop
    action = plan[cursor]
    if action.tool not in allow.tools: failed; stop        # authority, every step
    if action.requires_approval:
      approval = read approvals/<id>                        # the file IS the truth
      None     -> write pending; emit action.proposed, approval.requested; pause
      pending  -> pause
      denied   -> emit action.skipped; status = denied; stop
      granted  -> fall through and execute
    if action.effectful:
      if receipt exists for idempotency_key:
        emit receipt.reused, action.skipped                 # never call the tool twice
      else:
        emit tool.called; out = invoke_fake_tool(...)
        save receipt(out)                                   # <- the commit point
        emit tool.completed, receipt.created
    cursor += 1; save state                                 # <- the SOLE commit past a step
```

The one invariant that makes crash/resume safe: **advancing the cursor and saving state is the
only commit that moves past an action or clears an approval gate.** Until that save, the action
is "not done" durably. So every crash window resolves correctly:

- **Crash after the receipt, before the cursor advance** → resume re-enters the same action,
  the approval is still `granted`, the receipt scan hits, and it emits `receipt.reused` instead
  of calling the tool again. No duplicate effect.
- **Crash after the cursor advance** → resume enters at the next action; the finished one is
  never touched.
- **Crash during the pause** → resume sees the approval still `pending` and waits. The human
  decision is recorded once, by the `approve`/`deny` command, as a real event in the log.

Idempotency keys and approval/receipt ids are FNV-1a digests over a *canonical* (sorted-key)
byte serialization — no clock, no randomness — the same discipline as `store::fingerprint`.
`replay_action_run` re-derives the run purely: it reads the recorded approvals as the run's
human *inputs*, re-invokes the deterministic fake tools, and proves the terminal status and the
receipt set reproduce. (It deliberately does **not** compare event sequences: a crashed-then-
resumed run has a longer log than a straight one, yet produces identical effects.)

No ambient authority, and the working tree is never touched: an action goal proves its work
entirely through receipts under `.tach/goals/<run_id>/`.

## The plan language (`plan` + `runtime::drive_plan`)

The linear `ActionPlan` is a straight list of steps. The **plan language** generalizes it to a
real workflow: a `plan { ... }` block in goal source with `let` bindings, tool `call`s, `approve`
gates, `if`/`else`, and **`for`/`while` loops**. Expressions reuse the ordinary Tach grammar
(field access, arithmetic, `&&`/`||`/`!`, comparisons); the interpreter evaluates them in
JSON-value space, since that is what tools consume and receipts store. Two goals ship built-in:
`ReconcileChargebacks` (a `for` loop over a tool's output with a per-duplicate refund gate) and
`RetryFlakyDeploy` (a `while` retry loop that converges).

The execution model is **durable re-execution**. A run and a resume do the same thing: walk the
plan from the top. Tool calls are **memoized by their receipts**, which is what keeps loops and
long horizons safe:

```
exec_call(c):
  input = eval(c.input)                                  # JSON object
  call_index += 1                                        # walk-order ordinal
  if call_index > budget.steps: budget_exhausted
  if c.tool not in allow.tools: failed                   # authority, before any invoke
  key = idempotency_key(run_id, "c{call_index}", c.tool, input)
  if receipt exists for key: return recorded output      # MEMOIZED — no invoke, no events
  out = invoke_fake_tool(c.tool, input)
  save receipt(out)                                      # <- atomic commit point
  emit tool.called, tool.completed, receipt.created       # only after the receipt is durable
  crash-check; return out

exec_approve(summary, body):
  gate = approval_id(run_id, "gate{gate_index}"); gate_index += 1
  read approvals/<gate>:
    None | pending -> write/keep pending; emit action.proposed, approval.requested; PAUSE
    denied         -> emit action.skipped; status = denied; stop
    granted        -> execute body                        # the gated sub-plan runs now
```

`call_index` and `gate_index` are assigned in **walk order**, not at parse time. That matters for
two reasons: a loop's repeated `call` gets a distinct idempotency key per iteration, and the
assignment is **stable across resume**. Every call before the frontier is either a memoized
receipt or a pure deterministic fake tool, so the branches taken and loop counts come out
identical on every walk, and so do the ordinals and the keys. That stability is what lets
re-execution stand in for a saved program counter. `state.json` is never read back for control
flow; it is recomputed from the receipts and approvals dirs each time.

Every crash window is safe by the same argument as the action layer, minus the cursor. The
receipt write is the atomic commit. Crash before it and the call has no receipt, so the resume
re-invokes the deterministic tool and gets the same output. Crash after it and the resume finds
the receipt and returns it without invoking, so a refund inside a loop — crashed the instant
after it commits — is replayed for free and never issued twice. `replay_plan_run` is a separate
pure re-walk (`ReplayCtx`): it reads the recorded approvals as inputs, re-invokes the fake tools,
and proves the terminal status and receipt set reproduce. It shares the durable walk's expression
semantics, key formulas, and tools, so the two can't disagree on what they decide.

Budget bills tool calls reached per walk, so a `for`/`while` that calls tools is bounded by it; a
generous `PLAN_LOOP_LIMIT` separately catches a pathological call-free loop. Approval decisions
are final once made — the `approve`/`deny` command refuses to change a decided gate.

**Where the plan comes from on resume (`resolve_plan`).** A built-in plan goal carries no source
snapshot (`base_files` is empty); its plan is re-derived from the catalog by goal name on every
resume, the same way a replay re-runs the repair leaves — it is part of the binary's identity. A
**user-authored** plan goal is different: when the run starts, `start_plan_run` snapshots the
authoring workspace into `GoalRecord.base_files` (the same map repair goals snapshot), and
`resolve_plan` re-parses that **frozen snapshot** on resume/replay — never the live working tree.
Re-parsing the same source with the same binary is deterministic, so the walk-order ordinals and
idempotency keys re-derive identically and exactly-once still holds; and because the live file is
never read, editing it after a run starts cannot change a run already in flight. The plan checker
(`check::check_plan_goal`, surfaced as `tach goal check`) validates a user plan — ungranted/unknown
tools, unbound variables, unevaluable expressions, progress-free loops — before any of this runs.

**Audit-grade receipts.** Beyond the exactly-once core (`idempotency_key` + `output`), each receipt
records the `run_id` and `step` it committed at, the `effect`, an `input_hash`, the `approval_id`
that authorized it (for a gated effect), and the `created_event_id` of the history event that
recorded it — so a receipt is self-describing for export. These fields are `#[serde(default)]` and
invisible to replay (which compares only `idempotency_key → output`), so they change nothing about
reproduction.

## Why an interpreter (for now)

v0 prioritizes the *loop*, not raw runtime speed. A deterministic tree-walker is the fastest
path to a language that genuinely cooperates with agents, and determinism is a feature here
(replayable runs, trustworthy metrics). Native/LLVM codegen is a later concern; the
front-end, checker, and patch pipeline are the parts that carry the thesis and they're all
backend-agnostic.
