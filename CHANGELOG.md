## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **`perdure guard audit` could be fooled into certifying a failed run as a verified
  pass.** The hash chain anchored a receipt's existence and input, but its output block —
  including `exit_code` — was bound to nothing. Since `audit` derives the verified verdict
  by reading `exit_code` back out of the receipt, an agent with write access to `.perdure/`
  could rewrite a real failure (`exit 101 → 0`) and match `state.json` to it, and the audit
  reported "ledger intact". Each receipt's `receipt.created` event now anchors a SHA-256
  content hash of the receipt's *body* (input **and** output); `audit` recomputes it and the
  anchor is itself a chain link, so an edited exit code can no longer masquerade as a pass.
  Receipts written before the anchor degrade gracefully (existence checked, body treated as
  unverifiable rather than flagged). Regression-tested.
- **The installer now verifies the downloaded artifact against the release's
  `SHA256SUMS`** before unpacking, and aborts on a checksum mismatch.

### Fixed

- The first `perdure guard verify` on a fresh Rust checkout with no committed `Cargo.lock`
  was refused: `cargo test` regenerates the lockfile, which the pre-command scope gate saw
  as an out-of-scope write. `Cargo.lock` is now part of the Rust default `fs.write` scope, so
  lockfile churn is tracked by the gate rather than blocking adoption.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] — 2026-06-09

The first public alpha, and the release that renames the project: **tach is
now perdure** (`.pdr` sources, `Perdurefile`, `.perdure/` state directory,
`perdure.*.v1` schemas). PyPI's `tach` is an unrelated Python tool; `perdure`
— to endure permanently — is exactly the pitch.

### Added

- **Real tools in plans.** The plan language is no longer a fake-tool demo:
  - `call shell.run { cmd: "cargo test" }` executes a real process under the
    goal's exact-match command allowlist, with receipts, artifacts, scrubbed
    environment, sandbox `HOME`, and process-group timeouts.
  - `call http.get / http.post { url: ..., body: ..., headers: ...,
    headers_env: ... }` makes real HTTPS calls under URL-glob authority
    (`allow { http.post ["https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds"] }`),
    default-deny, redirects never followed, plaintext http only when the glob
    explicitly grants it.
  - Secrets never enter the store: `headers_env` names environment variables;
    values are read at call time and never serialized. A literal credential
    header is a check-time error (`E0439 secret_in_source`).
  - Exactly-once: receipts memoize completed calls across crash/resume, and
    every POST carries an `Idempotency-Key` derived from the receipt key.
  - A failing command or non-2xx response is an `ok:false` output the plan
    branches on — only a spawn/transport failure is a tool error (no receipt,
    safe to retry).
  - `authority.denied` ledger events record every refusal, before any I/O.
  - `budget { time: 20m }` is enforced for plan runs, billed deterministically
    from receipt durations.
  - Replay-from-receipts: `goal replay` re-walks the plan feeding recorded
    outputs back in, never re-fires a real effect, stops at a crashed run's
    exact frontier, and verifies the event hash chain.
- **Multi-file imports.** `import "./billing.pdr"` grants visibility into
  another file's functions and types (transitive; workspace-relative;
  cycles, escapes, and missing targets are errors E0470–E0472). A missing
  import is `E0473 symbol_not_imported` with a machine-applicable patch —
  `perdure fix` inserts it.
- **Comment-preserving formatter.** `perdure fmt` now formats files with
  comments instead of refusing them; no comment is ever lost, and formatting
  stays idempotent. Adjacent imports group into one block.
- **Distribution.** Prebuilt binaries (macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux x86_64 musl,
  Windows x86_64) on every tagged release, `install.sh`, and the `perdure`
  crate on crates.io.
- `perdure new <name> --goal shell` — a runnable real-command workflow
  scaffold (allowlist, approval gate, receipts, replay).
- New checker diagnostics: `E0438 command_ungranted`, `E0439
  secret_in_source`, `E0470 import_not_found`, `E0471
  import_outside_workspace`, `E0472 import_cycle`, `E0473
  symbol_not_imported`.

### Fixed

- The guard's sandbox `HOME` broke rustup's `cargo` shim ("no default toolchain"),
  killing verify on every rustup-managed Rust repo. `RUSTUP_HOME` now passes through
  (derived from the real home when unset) — it holds compilers, not credentials —
  while `CARGO_HOME` deliberately stays sandboxed. Found by dogfooding the guard on
  this repo (`docs/DOGFOOD.md`); the failed verify is preserved on that run's ledger.
- The guard verify timeout was 2 minutes — shorter than a cold first build of a real
  project. Now 10 minutes.

### Changed

- Renamed from tach: binary/crate `perdure`, sources `.pdr`, goal file
  `Perdurefile`, state dir `.perdure/`, ignore file `.perdureignore`, agent
  doc `PERDURE_AGENT.md`, MCP server/tools `perdure`/`perdure_guard_*`.
- Schema ids reset under the new namespace: `perdure.event.v1` (hash-chained;
  was `tach.event.v2`), `perdure.agent-context.v1`.
- The dependency posture: still no async runtime, no LLM SDKs, and no network
  code outside `src/http.rs` — which now exists, built on synchronous
  ureq + rustls (no system OpenSSL, fully static musl builds).

### Earlier history

Pre-rename development (the tach prototype: the repair loop, typed patches,
goal runtime, action layer, plan language, guard harness, agent interface,
and the hardening passes) is preserved in git history.
